Dear Reader,
This project is a simple Java application used for studying basic object oriented programming principles including encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction and polymorphism.
Also, during the implementation, I was introduced to new concepts like manager classes, testing and building basic user interfaces which helped me throught my software development journey.
